## Inspiration
As health-conscious hackers, we've always wanted a way to easily track nutrition data from our school's dining hall. After months of discussing the idea, we were thrilled to be able to make the project for this hackathon.
## What it does
This tracker is built off of scraped data from the UNC dining hall website. Users can choose their date, meal time, dining hall section, meal, and number of servings!
## How we built it
The data was scraped using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, and then we used Angular to implement the front-end interface.
## Challenges we ran into
Scraping the data was very tough because we had to dive into the world of asynchronous functions for the first time. Also, some large tests of scraping would fail on the last line of code, after hours of running the Python script, only for the data to be lost forever. 
We also expanded our Angular knowledge greatly, especially around the topic of Objects.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the detailed and organized data that we scraped from the dining hall website, the applicability of the project, and the hurdles we overcame with Angular.
## What we learned
We learned a whole lot about web scraping, web manipulation with Selenium, TypeScript, .json files, and Angular!
## What's next for CDS Nutrition Tracker
We would like to expand our nutrition data (which will require hours of Python script running) and implement a calendar date picker. In the long term, we would love to connect a database so that users can upload and keep track of long-term nutrition data.
